of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama   i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austens subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p & p is not about passion sexual tension or love its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots   particularly in this film   to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances it was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film the humour   which is pride & prejudice both austens methodology and her appeal   was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you cant lose jane austens technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeths wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with  what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation   and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austens elizabeth at least in austens eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightleys elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfayden donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen   delivered with remarkable clumsiness   and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache',\n",

committed to whatever it is   and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but were all different `made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though   and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things   life   work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed   and how one `gets committed   and obsession in `committed starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story \\tadmittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general shes a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson its forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl   and 597 days into the marriage hes gone off to `find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes hes not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe its because of that `clay shes made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does   in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his `space and not even letting him know shes there she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma and its her job to keep a `spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmens `grampy alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline its a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself \\ttheres a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from jolines point of view as krueger makes us privy to jolines thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling theres an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life \\theather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable   and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely its all a part of the character she creates theres an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out shes a likable agreeable person and because youve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is its a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life \\tas carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life \\toverall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as jolines brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character \\tthe supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carls editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture   reflecting upon who we are where were going and what we really need   `committed is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 8 10',\n",

nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or

inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence im like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there  the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100% unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like shes on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie shes no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release',\n",

which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer \\x96 when its in the right hands that is \\x96 a bugs life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions it is only pixars second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film after all its a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bugs life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter not only are they all entirely amiable and likable \\x96 there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters \\x96 but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his antics the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers if you think about it a bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies \\x96 one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively as ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film \\x96 the clichéd kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like however its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bugs life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year \\x96 and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of 1998 85 10',\n",

to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes  of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what i would have done in that scene too if i were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original  but i can not know for sure lets see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately ',\n",

playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local café the chipmunks are playing a game of around the world in 30 days against the chipettesbrittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin gets in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a 100000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped its also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting luckykind of suggestive for a kids film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian princes men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to black classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it a watch its worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80s gets a solid 10 out of 10  headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now',\n",

of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama   i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austens subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p & p is not about passion sexual tension or love its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots   particularly in this film   to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances it was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film the humour   which is pride & prejudice both austens methodology and her appeal   was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you cant lose jane austens technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeths wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with  what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation   and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austens elizabeth at least in austens eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightleys elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfayden donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen   delivered with remarkable clumsiness   and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache',\n",

committed to whatever it is   and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but were all different `made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though   and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things   life   work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed   and how one `gets committed   and obsession in `committed starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story \\tadmittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general shes a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson its forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl   and 597 days into the marriage hes gone off to `find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes hes not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe its because of that `clay shes made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does   in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his `space and not even letting him know shes there she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma and its her job to keep a `spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmens `grampy alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline its a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself \\ttheres a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from jolines point of view as krueger makes us privy to jolines thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling theres an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life \\theather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable   and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely its all a part of the character she creates theres an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out shes a likable agreeable person and because youve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is its a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life \\tas carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life \\toverall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as jolines brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character \\tthe supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carls editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture   reflecting upon who we are where were going and what we really need   `committed is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 8 10',\n",

nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or

inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence im like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there  the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100% unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like shes on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie shes no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release',\n",

which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer \\x96 when its in the right hands that is \\x96 a bugs life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions it is only pixars second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film after all its a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bugs life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter not only are they all entirely amiable and likable \\x96 there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters \\x96 but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his antics the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers if you think about it a bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies \\x96 one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively as ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film \\x96 the clichéd kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like however its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bugs life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year \\x96 and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of 1998 85 10',\n",

to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes  of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what i would have done in that scene too if i were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original  but i can not know for sure lets see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately ',\n",

playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local café the chipmunks are playing a game of around the world in 30 days against the chipettesbrittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin gets in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a 100000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped its also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting luckykind of suggestive for a kids film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian princes men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to black classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it a watch its worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80s gets a solid 10 out of 10  headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now',\n",
